Background processing queue for MarkLogic Server

Description
-----------

The normal task server queue doesn't discriminate between kinds of tasks. CPF processing can for instance flood the queue, and cause front-end request respond slowly. This queue is maintained separately, allows prioritizing, and the cron is designed only to launch tasks when the task server has spare threads. In other words, ideal for background processing.

This code was written as an example, has not been tested in real life. Feedback is welcome.

Installation
------------

- Drop the contents of this folder anywhere, where it is accessible by MarkLogic Server. So upload it to Modules, or drop in below a folder that has been specified as root of one of your app servers. Personally, I tested it in a subfolder called /tasks/ of the root folder of one my HTTP app servers.
- Access the code through http://localhost:nnnn/path-to-ml-queue/ (for instance in my case http://localhost:8000/tasks/)
- It shows the Task queue manager. The top shows some usefull utilities, and details. Then the option to create a task. At the bottom the current queue.
- As example create the following tasks: /path-to-ml-queue/task-a.xqy, /path-to-ml-queue/task-b.xqy, /path-to-ml-queue/task-c.xqy (default prio)
- The queue initially shows them in creation order.
- Hit + behind task a, it will move to the bottom of the queue.
- Hit - behind task c, it will move to the top of the queue.
- Now you can hit 'start cron'. After a 10 sec delay, the manager is shown again, stating the cron is active. First task (being task c) should have already been taken from the queue.
- Hit 'auto refresh' near the top to follow progress with a 5 sec refresh rate. Cron sleeps at intervals of 1 minute.
- Hit 'stop cron' once the queue is empty. (Hit 'auto refresh' again to follow progress, cron should deactivate in max 1 minute.)

The cron process and the three tasks write log messages. Check ErrorLog.txt, it should report messages like follows:
